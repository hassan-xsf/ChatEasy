# EasyChat v0.1 üéâ
#### Made using MERN stack.

### Things I learned in this project:
1. How to use typescript in backend and frontend.
2. Implementing real-time message notifications (Web Sockets using Socket.IO)
3. Handling complex APIs, aggregation pipelines etc.


# INTRODUCTION üôå
This project was just made to practice typescript, This is my first ever project using typescript after I literally crash learned it in 2 days.
I created this project just to practice with sockets.io and typescript, Took it too far.
Got bored, So couldn't focus on more but there's so much that can be implemented such as group chats, Online status etc.

Although this is a very beginner friendly project, This project is just to furnish my skills. Incase of any issues/bugs, I am always available üòÄ
